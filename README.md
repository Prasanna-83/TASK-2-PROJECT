MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM 
Movie Recommendation System is predicting the next movie tht the user like to watch. 
By taking the  dataset THE MOVIE DATASET here we are  recommending the movies based on the genre and the movie line or the description.
we build a MACHINE LEARNING MODEL and  calculate the cosine similarity between the vectors and draw the similarities between the moviees and recommend the movies.
By using this ml model we draw conclusions and recomendatiions in this project of DATASCIENCE
